# To-Do List Web Application

## 📝 Overview
**To-Do List Web Application** is a simple yet powerful task management app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to add, remove, edit, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved in the browser using **localStorage**, ensuring that they persist even when the browser is closed or refreshed. 

This project focuses on practical use of:
- Event handling (click, contextmenu, etc.)
- DOM manipulation (creating and removing elements)
- Data persistence using `localStorage`
- Responsive design to ensure it works well on mobile and desktop

## 🌟 Features
- **Add Tasks**: Add a new task by entering the task title and clicking "Add".
- **Delete Tasks**: Easily remove tasks with the "Delete" button.
- **Mark as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed, and it will visually change (e.g., line-through effect).
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage, so they persist even after a browser refresh or closing.
- **Edit Tasks**: Double-click on any task to edit its title.
